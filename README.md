# Graph Plotting Application

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with `PySimpleGUI` and `Matplotlib` for creating and managing multiple function plots. The application allows users to input mathematical functions, customize plot settings, and interactively manipulate the display of graphs.

## Features

 **Multiple Graphs**: Add, remove, and toggle the visibility of multiple function plots.
 **Interactive Controls**: Use checkboxes to show/hide specific functions, and change the color of the graph through a color picker.
 **Custom Scaling**: Adjust the x and y axis ranges via input fields to zoom in or out of specific areas of the plot.
 **Graph Toolbar**: Integrated navigation toolbar for zooming and panning within the plot.

## Dependencies

 - `PySimpleGUI`
 - `Matplotlib`
 - `Numpy`

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install PySimpleGUI matplotlib numpy
```

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the Python script to open the GUI.
2. **Input Functions**: Enter your mathematical function in the provided input field.
3. **Add Graph**: Click the "Добавить график" button to plot the function.
4. **Customize**: Use the controls on the side panel to adjust scaling and color.
5. **Toggle Visibility**: Check or uncheck the boxes to show/hide graphs.
6. **Remove Graphs**: Click the corresponding button to delete a graph from the plot.
